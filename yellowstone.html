    <h1>Yellowstone National Park</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A vast wilderness of geothermal wonders, rich wildlife, and breathtaking landscapes, Yellowstone is the birthplace of the National Park idea and remains one of the world’s most treasured natural sanctuaries.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Established in 1872, Yellowstone National Park covers over 2.2 million acres, stretching across Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. It is globally renowned for its extraordinary geothermal features, which include more than 10,000 hydrothermal sites and over 500 active geysers — the largest concentration of such features on Earth. Beyond its geothermal marvels, the park offers spectacular canyons, alpine rivers, lush forests, and expansive valleys teeming with wildlife.</p>
      <p>Yellowstone’s designation as the first national park in the United States marked the beginning of a global movement to preserve natural and cultural treasures for future generations. Today, it draws millions of visitors each year who come to witness its unique landscapes and abundant biodiversity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>For thousands of years before its establishment as a park, Yellowstone was inhabited and traversed by Indigenous peoples, including the Kiowa, Blackfeet, Cayuse, Coeur d'Alene, and Shoshone. Archaeological evidence shows that humans have lived in and used the area for more than 11,000 years, hunting, fishing, and gathering plants.</p>
      <p>European American exploration of the area began in the early 19th century, with fur trappers and mountain men reporting strange “fire and brimstone” landscapes. In 1871, the Hayden Geological Survey brought back detailed descriptions and photographs that captured the imagination of Congress and the public. The result was the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act, signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, creating the first area in the world to be set aside for preservation and public enjoyment.</p>

      <h2>Geography & Geology</h2>
      <p>Yellowstone sits atop a supervolcano whose massive caldera measures roughly 30 by 45 miles. This volcanic hotspot fuels the park’s extraordinary geothermal activity. Its last cataclysmic eruption occurred about 640,000 years ago, shaping much of the current landscape.</p>
      <p>The park’s terrain ranges from deep canyons and towering waterfalls to rolling meadows and high mountain peaks. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, with its striking yellow, orange, and red cliffs, is carved by the Yellowstone River and features dramatic drops like the 308-foot Lower Falls. Yellowstone Lake, one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America, sits atop an active volcanic chamber, and its floor contains hydrothermal vents and other volcanic features.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Wildlife</h2>
      <p>Yellowstone is a sanctuary for a remarkable diversity of wildlife. It is one of the last intact ecosystems in the temperate world, hosting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>American bison — the largest land mammals in North America and a symbol of the park</li>
        <li>Grizzly and black bears, often seen foraging in meadows or along riverbanks</li>
        <li>Gray wolves — reintroduced in 1995, restoring a critical predator to the ecosystem</li>
        <li>Elk, moose, pronghorn, and bighorn sheep</li>
        <li>Bird species such as bald eagles, trumpeter swans, peregrine falcons, and sandhill cranes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lamar Valley and Hayden Valley are among the best spots for wildlife viewing, especially at dawn and dusk when animals are most active.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Old Faithful:</strong> The world-famous geyser that erupts about every 90 minutes, sending a column of hot water and steam skyward.</li>
        <li><strong>Grand Prismatic Spring:</strong> The largest hot spring in the United States, known for its vivid rings of color caused by heat-loving microorganisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Mammoth Hot Springs:</strong> Terraced formations created by mineral deposits from hot water flowing over limestone.</li>
        <li><strong>The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone:</strong> Offering dramatic views from Artist Point and Inspiration Point.</li>
        <li><strong>Yellowstone Lake:</strong> A vast alpine lake ideal for boating, fishing, and wildlife watching.</li>

      <h2>Recreation</h2>
      <p>Yellowstone offers a wide range of recreational opportunities year-round. In summer, visitors can hike over 900 miles of trails, enjoy scenic drives, fish in pristine rivers, and go boating on Yellowstone Lake. Winter transforms the park into a snowy wonderland, perfect for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and guided snowmobile tours.</p>
      <p>Camping is available in multiple campgrounds, but reservations are recommended, especially in peak season. Backcountry camping requires permits, and travelers should be prepared for rapidly changing weather and potential wildlife encounters.</p>

      <h2>Visitor Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Always maintain safe distances from wildlife: at least 25 yards from bison, elk, and deer, and 100 yards from bears and wolves.</li>
        <li>Stay on boardwalks and marked trails in geothermal areas to avoid unstable ground and scalding water.</li>
        <li>Pack layers — temperatures can fluctuate dramatically even within the same day.</li>
        <li>Arrive early to popular sites to avoid crowds, especially during summer.</li>
        <li>Carry bear spray and know how to use it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preservation</h2>
      <p>Yellowstone faces ongoing conservation challenges, including balancing increasing visitation with the need to protect its fragile ecosystems. Efforts include wildlife monitoring, habitat restoration, fire management, and educating visitors about responsible park use. The park’s preservation ensures that its wonders will endure for generations to come.</p>

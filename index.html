    <p class="subtitle">A heartfelt welcome to your gateway into America’s most treasured natural wonders.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Welcome to America’s National Parks</h2>
      <p>
        We are so glad you’re here. Whether you’ve arrived out of curiosity, longing for inspiration, or planning your next big adventure, you’ve stepped into a space that celebrates the heart and soul of the United States — its breathtaking National Parks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine the golden glow of dawn spilling over the towering granite walls of Yosemite, the deep hush of snow settling over Denali’s peaks, the gentle whisper of wind weaving through ancient sequoias, and the distant rumble of bison hooves across Yellowstone’s plains. These moments, both grand and intimate, are the treasures our parks hold for all who seek them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our parks are more than just land; they are living stories, shaped over millennia by nature’s hand and preserved through the dedication of countless individuals. They are home to elusive wildlife, fragile ecosystems, and landscapes that stir something deep within us. Each park is a reminder that we are part of something vast, wild, and beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this site, you can journey from the coral waters of Biscayne to the rugged cliffs of Zion, from the sunlit canyons of Utah to the misty rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. Along the way, you’ll discover unique wildlife, learn fascinating histories, and perhaps even find your next travel destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, take your time here. Wander freely. Let your imagination hike the trails, soar with the eagles, and rest beside alpine lakes. Whether you explore just one page or all fifteen, we hope you leave with a renewed appreciation for the wild beauty that belongs to all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome — the parks are calling, and your adventure starts now.

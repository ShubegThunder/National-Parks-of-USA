    <h1>Yosemite National Park</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A masterpiece carved by ice and stone—home to towering granite domes, cascading waterfalls, ancient sequoias, and sweeping wild expanses.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Established in 1890, Yosemite National Park spans approximately 759,620 acres in California’s Sierra Nevada. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, the park protects an extraordinary variety of landscapes, including granite cliffs, glacial valleys, giant sequoia groves, rivers, and waterfalls. Nearly 95% of the park is designated wilderness, offering visitors a chance to experience nature in its purest form.

      <h2>Geology & Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        The centerpiece of Yosemite is the valley itself, a U-shaped glacial valley framed by dramatic granite monoliths such as El Capitan, rising 3,000 feet from base to summit, and the iconic Half Dome, whose sheer face and rounded back make it one of the most recognizable peaks in the world. Beyond the valley, the park encompasses rugged high country, alpine meadows, and pristine rivers that reflect the ever-changing light of the Sierra Nevada.

      <h2>Waterfalls</h2>
      <p>
        Yosemite Falls, dropping a total of 2,425 feet, is the tallest waterfall in North America and a highlight in spring when snowmelt swells its flow. Other notable waterfalls include Bridalveil Fall, which greets visitors at the valley entrance, and Vernal and Nevada Falls along the Mist Trail. In February, the rare “Firefall” phenomenon sets Horsetail Fall aglow with the colors of sunset.

      <h2>History & Conservation</h2>
      <p>
        Long before its designation as a national park, Yosemite was home to the Ahwahneechee people, whose cultural heritage remains integral to the park’s identity. In 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation protecting Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove, marking the first time land was set aside for preservation and public use. The work of conservationists like John Muir helped inspire the establishment of Yosemite National Park and the broader National Park System.

      <h2>Wildlife</h2>
      <p>
        Yosemite supports a diverse range of wildlife, from black bears and mule deer to bobcats, coyotes, and more than 250 species of birds. Higher elevations provide habitat for species such as marmots and pikas, while rivers and lakes host trout and other aquatic life.

        Yosemite is a playground for outdoor enthusiasts. Visitors can explore over 750 miles of trails, ranging from short nature walks to challenging backcountry treks. The park is a world-renowned rock climbing destination, with climbers tackling routes on El Capitan and Half Dome. In winter, the Badger Pass Ski Area offers downhill and cross-country skiing.

      <h2>Preservation</h2>
      <p>
